Telecom User Engagement Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes user engagement in a telecom dataset using metrics such as session frequency, 
session duration, and total traffic (download and upload). The analysis aims to:

Key Analyses
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Initial exploration of the telecom dataset, including visualizing the distribution of handset types and descriptive statistics.

Data Cleaning and Imputation:
Handling missing values in key columns like RTT, throughput, and retransmission volumes using statistical methods (mean/median filling).

Customer Experience & Engagement Clustering:
Users are clustered based on network parameters such as average throughput, RTT, and TCP retransmissions. These clusters provide insights into the overall network experience.

Satisfaction Score Visualization:
Visualizing customer satisfaction based on engagement and experience scores to understand the quality of service and user perception.
