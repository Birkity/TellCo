Telecom User Engagement Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes user engagement in a telecom dataset using metrics such as session frequency, session duration, and total traffic (download and upload). The analysis aims to:

Aggregate user engagement metrics per customer.
Classify users into engagement clusters using K-means clustering.
Identify the top applications and users by traffic.
Optimize K-means clustering using the elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters.
Key Features
Data Aggregation: Aggregates session frequency, duration, and total traffic per user.
Clustering: Uses K-means clustering to segment users into engagement levels based on normalized metrics.
Application Usage Analysis: Aggregates user traffic per application and identifies the top users and most used apps.
Elbow Method: Optimizes K for K-means clustering using the elbow method.
